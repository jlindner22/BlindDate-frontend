This is a social/dating application that allows users to create a personality profile and interact with other user profiles. This application utilizes React and Redux on the frontend along with a Ruby on Rails backend. It was styled using custom CSS and Semantic UI.

After running the backend Rails server ([Backend Repo](https://github.com/jlindner22/BlindDate-backend)), the frontend can be run with the command 'npm start' in the terminal.

Check it out on [Heroku](http://blinddate-js.herokuapp.com/)!
