This is a social/dating application that allows users to create a personality profile and interact with other user profiles. This application utilizes React and Redux on the frontend along with a Ruby on Rails backend. It was styled using custom CSS and Semantic UI.

After running the backend Rails server (repo link below), the frontend can be run with the command 'npm start' in the terminal.
Check it out on [Heroku](http://blinddate-js.herokuapp.com/)!
